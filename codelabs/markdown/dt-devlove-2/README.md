### Abstract of Episode 2 
We will level up our manual testing with continuous validations with the help of Synthetic Testing. Testing REST Microservices and FullBrowser evaluations and tests we **make sure** that the key functionalities we developed works as designed and expected in every release and stage automatically. 

Performance Problems, Scalability issues and Optimizations can be unveiled under load üî•. Exactly where the application is needed the most (under load) is where it should NOT fail. It‚Äôs important to unveil the limits of each application, understand if it can scale horizontally and/or vertically so it can be sized properly and not waste resources (money) just because of not knowing the limits of a system. This is why automated quality gates with automated performance testing, validation and release comparison is so important. Make sure automatically that every release works, every important KPI is fulfilled such as business, architecture, infrastructure and performance SLOs (Service Level Objectives) by every pull requests or merge on a branch. We will understand how the Quality Gate works, how the Load test is automatically integrated in Dynatrace and how all systems such as AzureDevOps, the application, Keptn and Dynatrace form an ecosystem and are tight together.
In this Episode we will explain the CICD environment, the QualityGates, the session-based load test, the SLI/SLOs and best practices on them such as validate the end2end functionality of a system, the vertical stack and shift business KPIs into the validation. We will also learn how the integration works and the foundations of loadtest analysis with Dynatrace.

: This systematic and generic approach can be applied to any software that Dynatrace monitors and any CI/CD pipeline that our customers may use, meaning we can speed up üöÄ their delivery up to 80% while ensuring the functionality and a higher level of quality of their released software ‚úÖ.
